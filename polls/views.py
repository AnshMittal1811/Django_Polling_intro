		#Redisplay the question voting form.
#		return render(request,'polls/detail.html', {

#			})
	

#	else: 
#		selected_choice.votes = F('votes')+1
#		selected_choice.save()
		#Always return an HttpResponseRedirect after successfully dealing with POST data. This prevents data from being posted twice if a user hits the Back button
#		return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('polls:results', args=(question.id,)))
